/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Api Responser Trait
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This trait will be used for any response we sent to clients.
  Response code ->
    200: OK. The standard success code and default option.
    201: Object created. Useful for the store actions.
    204: No content. When an action was executed successfully, but there is no content to return.
    206: Partial content. Useful when you have to return a paginated list of resources.
    400: Bad request. The standard option for requests that fail to pass validation.
    401: Unauthorized. The user needs to be authenticated.
    403: Forbidden. The user is authenticated, but does not have the permissions to perform an action.
    404: Not found. This will be returned automatically by Laravel when the resource is not found.
    500: Internal server error. Ideally you're not going to be explicitly returning this, but if something unexpected breaks, this is what your user is going to receive.
    503: Service unavailable. Pretty self explanatory, but also another code that is not going to be returned explicitly by the application.
